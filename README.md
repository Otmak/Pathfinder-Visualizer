Pathfinding visualizer is a web application built with `HTML/CSS` and `JavaScript`. It utilizes different search algorithms to search and visualize the shortest path. The algorithms operate on a 2d array which is represented as a Grid. The Grid, and animation are all done using the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API).
