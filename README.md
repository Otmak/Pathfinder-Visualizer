The application uses different search algorithms to search and visualise the shortest path. These algorithms operate on a 2d array which is represented in this application as a ***Grid***. The Grid, and animations are all done using the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API).

The folowing are the algorithms visualized in this application:

***1. Depth First Search.*** \
***2. Breadth First Search.*** \
***3. Dijkstra.*** \
***4. Astar.***
